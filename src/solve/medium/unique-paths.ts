/**
 * 62. Unique Paths (Medium)
 * 
 * There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]).
 * The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]).
 * The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 * Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: m = 3, n = 7
 * Output: 28

// Test cases
console.log(uniquePaths(3, 7)); // Expected: 28
