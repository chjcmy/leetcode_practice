/**
 * 42. Trapping Rain Water (Hard)
 * 
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
 * compute how much water it can trap after raining.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
 * In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

// Test cases
console.log(trap([0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1])); // Expected: 6
console.log(trap([4,2,0,3,2,5])); // Expected: 9
