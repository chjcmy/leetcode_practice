/**
 * 130. Surrounded Regions (Medium)
 * 
 * Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
 * Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
